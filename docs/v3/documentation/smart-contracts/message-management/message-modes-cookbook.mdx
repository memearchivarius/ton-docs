# Message Modes Cookbook

Understanding the different modes and flags available for sending messages is important to ensure that your smart contracts behave correctly. 
While [Message-modes](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages#message-modes) section provided detailed descriptions of these modes and flags, in this section we will illustrate their practical application with concrete examples.

:::info IMPORTANT
The result of the error cases is described when the error occurred.

__Note__: The transaction fees used in these examples are hypothetical and are used for illustrative purposes only. Actual transaction fees will vary depending on network conditions and other factors.

__Note__: When message is received, part of it will be consumed for gas and storage fees.

You can check [this example](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/42ed45726e4fe994b7fd6dbf953a2ac24ecd77753858abeda9d6755c664a537a) as a real-world confirmation

## 1. Send a regular message

Fwd_fee and action_fee will be deducted from message.
You sent 1 TON, fee is 0.04 TON, actual received value will be 0.96 TON.

| Mode and Flags | Code |
|:-|:-|
| `mode` = 0, no `flag` | `send_raw_message(msg, 0)` |

## 2. Send a regular message, no bounce the message on error and ignore it

Fwd_fee and action_fee will be deducted from message.
You sent 1 TON, fee is 0.04 TON, actual received value will be 0.96 TON.
In case of an error during transaction processing, the message will not bounce and will be ignored.

:::info tip 
Funds included with ignored message still will be [credited to receiving address](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/5e6a7b8b21efd57db46466a4563924cbf0556371598f5a92331ecd3673b60f3f)

| Mode and Flags | Code |
|:-|:-|
| `mode` = 0, `flag` = 2 | `send_raw_message(msg, 2)` |

## 3. Send a regular message and bounce the message on error

Fwd_fee and action_fee will be deducted from message.
You sent 1 TON, fee is 0.04 TON, actual received value will be 0.96 TON.
If an [error occurs during action processing](https://retracer.ton.org/?tx=e9dccba82badc0d742f14eff41c203280f380e87180b5314fcfd742856e598f7&testnet=true) - bounce the message.
Then total fee + fwd_fee will be deducted and bounced value will be 1 - `total_fee` TON.

| Mode and Flags | Code |
|:-|:-|
| `mode` = 0, `flag` = 16 | `send_raw_message(msg, 16)` |

## 4. Send a regular message with separate fees

Fwd_fee and action_fee will be deducted from contract balance.
You sent 1 TON, fee is 0.04 TON, actual received value will be 1 TON.

| Mode and Flags | Code |
|:-|:-|
| `mode` = 0, `flag` = 1 | `send_raw_message(msg, 1)` |

## 5. Send a regular message with separate fees and bounce the message on error

Fwd_fee and action_fee will be deducted from contract balance.
You sent 1 TON, fee is 0.04 TON, actual received value will be 1 TON.
if an error occurs during action processing - bounce the message.
Then total fee + fwd_fee will be deducted and bounced value will be 1 - `total_fee` TON.

| Mode and Flags | Code |
|:-|:-|
| `mode` = 0, `flag` = 1 + 16 = 17 | `send_raw_message(msg, 17)` |

## 6. Carry remaining value with new message

Fwd_fee and action_fee will be deducted from message.
You received X TON, then sent 1 TON, fee is 0.04 TON, actual received value will be X + 0.96 TON.

| Mode and Flags | Code |
|:-|:-|
| `mode` = 64, no `flag` | `send_raw_message(msg, 64)` |

## 7. Carry remaining value with new message with separate fees

Fwd_fee and action_fee will be deducted from contract.
You received X TON, then sent 1 TON, fee is 0.04 TON, actual received value will be X + 1 TON.

| Mode and Flags | Code |
|:-|:-|
| `mode` = 64, `flag` = 1 | `send_raw_message(msg, 65)` |

## 8. Carry remaining value and bounce the message on error

Fwd_fee and action_fee will be deducted from message.
You received X TON, then sent 1 TON, fee is 0.04 TON, actual received value will be X + 0.96 TON.
If an error occurs during action processing - bounce the message.
Then total fee + fwd_fee will be deducted from in_msg and bounced value will be X - `total_fee` TON.

| `mode` = 64, `flag` = 16 | `send_raw_message(msg, 80)` |

## 9. Carry remaining value with new message with separate fees and bounce the message on error

Fwd_fee and action_fee will be deducted from contract.
You received X TON, then sent 1 TON, fee is 0.04 TON, actual received value will be X + 1 TON.
If an error occurs during action processing - bounce the message.
Then total fee + fwd_fee will be deducted from in_msg and bounced value will be X - `total_fee` TON.

| Mode and Flags | Code |
|:-|:-|
| `mode` = 64, `flag` = 16 + 1 | `send_raw_message(msg, 81)` |

## 10. Send all received tokens together with the contract balance

Fwd_fee and action_fee will be deducted from message.
We currently have 100 Toncoin in the balance of our smart contract.
After receiving an internal message with X TON we send a message, fee is 0.04 TON, actual received value will be X + 100 - 0.04 TON.

| Mode and Flags | Code |
|:-|:-|
| `mode` = 128, no `flag` | `send_raw_message(msg, 128)` |

## 11. Send all received tokens together with the contract balance and bounce the message on error

Fwd_fee and action_fee will be deducted from message.
We currently have 100 Toncoin in the balance of our smart contract.
After receiving an internal message with X TON we send a message, fee is 0.04 TON, actual received value will be X + 100 - 0.04 TON.
If an error occurs during action processing - bounce the message.
Then total fee + fwd_fee will be deducted from in_msg and bounced value will be X - `total_fee` TON.

| `mode` = 128, `flag` = 16 | `send_raw_message(msg, 144)` |

## 12. Send all received tokens together with the contract balance and destroy smart-contract

Fwd_fee and action_fee will be deducted from message.
We currently have 100 Toncoin in the balance of our smart contract.
After receiving an internal message with X TON we send a message, fee is 0.04 TON, actual received value will be X + 100 - 0.04 TON.
When the balance reaches 0 TON destroy the contract.
